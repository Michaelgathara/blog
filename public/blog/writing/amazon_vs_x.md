# Why Amazon?
#### This is part of a `quick-reads` series, thus less formal and shorter than my other posts
WeChat integrates various services into one platform, including messaging, payments, shopping, social media, and the ability to download mini-apps. It's a one-stop shop for anything you would ever want to use. This approach has revolutionized the way people interact with technology in East Asia. The West has yet to see the emergence of an actual everything app. Elon Musk has vowed to introduce the first wep, but X has a long way to go; X (formerly Twitter) is currently nothing more than a text and video-based social media platform. On top of this, X struggles with brand partnerships, and keeping advertisers happy, which is crucial if you plan on building a wep.

On the other hand, Amazon has a vast ecosystem of shopping, music, movies/shows, reading, audiobooks, and (less known) social media (think of those TikTok-like videos you see on the Amazon app) prowess. Their partnerships with banks such as Chase for their Amazon card already give them the ability to act as a gatekeeper for your bank account by offering you Amazon benefits for using their card, not to mention that they have enough cash on hand (~$60B as of the time of writing) to buy out Discover (Mkt Cap: ~$23B). Their AWS platform can act as a cloud provider if they also integrate mini-apps. 

Will Amazon build a wep? most likely not.<br>
Could they if they wanted to? yes, and much easier than X.

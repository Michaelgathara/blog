# Introduction

    Brief introduction of the article's objective, i.e., to understand functional programming in Python.

## Section 1: What is Functional Programming?

    Define Functional Programming (FP).
    Discuss the benefits and challenges of FP.

## Section 2: Functional Programming and Python

    Describe how Python supports functional programming.
    Discuss immutability in Python.
    Mention Python's functional programming tools such as lambda, map(), filter(), reduce(), list comprehension, etc.

## Section 3: An Introduction to Key Concepts in Functional Programming

    Pure Functions: Define and provide Python examples.
    Recursion: Explain what recursion is and how it's used in FP, again providing Python examples.
    Higher-Order Functions: Define and provide Python examples.

## Section 4: Advanced Functional Programming in Python

    Function Composition: Explain what it is and provide examples.
    Currying and Partial Function Application: Define these concepts and provide Python examples.

## Section 5: Libraries for Functional Programming in Python

    Introduction to libraries like functools, itertools, toolz, fn.py which help facilitate functional programming in Python.

## Section 6: Practical Examples of Functional Programming in Python

    Provide a problem and solve it using the functional approach.
    Alternatively, refactor a piece of imperative or object-oriented code into a functional style, explaining the process and the benefits gained.

## Conclusion

    Summarize the main points made in the blog post.
    Encourage readers to practice functional programming in Python.
    Mention that while Python isn't a purely functional language like Haskell or Erlang, functional programming concepts can still be very useful in Python programming.
